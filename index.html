				<h1> About Us </h1>
				<h2> History </h2>
				Queendom Co. was founded in 2020 by myself and my partner, and a little 
				<br> help from our friend Mallory, right at the start of Covid. It was so hard 
				<br> to sit at home doing nothing, so this became my sole focus in the 
				<br> middle of the chaos. For years, I have struggled to find quality gym clothing 
				<br> for women at a reasonable price. I would always complain to my boyfriend about 
				<br> how guys have these really good quality and reasonably priced gym-wear, 
				<br> but women are stuck with overpriced leggings that cost over $100.
				<br> New gym apparel brands pop up over night for guys, but not so much for women. 
				<br> We got to talking about this problem with Mallory and Queendom started with just the three of us. 
				<br> In the beginning we were only selling sports bras and leggings, 
				<br> but in the past 3 years we have expanded quite a bit. 
				<br> Now we are made up of over 50 employees in our two locations 
				<br> and we have a product launch coming up at the end of June for our fall line.
				<br> We have evolved to an established company as opposed to Ben, Mallory, and I 
				<br> sitting in our guest bedroom packaging our designs. <br /> <br />

				<h2> Why Use Us? </h2>
				Queendom Co. is a brand made by women for women. 
				<br> Queendom stands to create jobs for young people and educate the youth 
				<br> in our communities. We want to compete with the brands that have 
				<br> the most market share of the fitness industry. We aren't just a fitness wear company, 
				<br> we are based out of Massachusetts, but have another location in Florida. 
				<br> All of the big fitness brands are based out of California, on the West Coast, 
				<br> but we are based and dominate the East Coast, which is our niche market.
				<br> We stand for fearlessness, strength, and innovation. 
				<br> We know that the next generation is the future so we started an internship program 
				<br> in the spring and fall where female students can shadow every aspect of the business 
				<br> and potentially land a job here at Queendom. We want to empower the next 
				<br> generation of businesswomen and female athletes to make a difference in their future. <br /> <br />  <br />
